# DAML-Escrow
 For Devpost 6-week smart contract hackathon

This repository contains a partial prototype for a decentralized escrow system developed using DAML. In a decentralized escrow system, the sender and receiver of money don't need to trust a third party. In this project, three roles are implemented - 'UserAdmin', 'Financer' and 'Worker'. Apart of other parameters, the 'Financer' and 'Worker' each have a wallet respectively. Next there is a 'Project' entity which also has an 'Escrow' wallet. Ideally, project and 'Escrow' account shuld have been different entities but for simplicity in this project 'Escrow' wallet is a part of 'Project' entity. Users in other roles are allowed to join the network by the network admin after they request the admin. The 'Financer' can create a 'Project'. A 'Project' has a 'price' associated with it and also a 'Worker'. As soon as a 'Financer' creates a project, the amount equal to price of project is deducted from his wallet and credited to 'Escrow' wallet within 'Project' entity. The 'Financer' then has no way to get the amount back to his wallet. The 'Financer' can however transfer the amount to 'Worker' associated with 'project' after 'project' completion. Similarly, the 'worker' cannot get money to his acccount from 'escrow' but can transfer back to 'financer' in case of project termination due to a genuine reason. This 'escrow' incentivizes fair behavior in both parties. 

In the current implementation of prototype, the 'escrow' wallet and 'financer' wallet is getting updated properly on project creation and 'escrow' wallet is getting updated properly on project completion and project termination. However, the update of wallets of 'financer' on project termination and 'worker' on project completion is not happening and code needs to be improved. The code is compiling properly. Front-end integration has not been done in this prototype.

There are two daml files - Main.daml and UserAdmin.daml .
